        As a native to the Richmond Area, I have grown up loving this part of
        the state. With our close proximity to the coast and the beautiful
        Blue Ridge mountains, central Virginia has so much to offer.

        I have extensive knowledge of the area and I am passionate about
        real estate. However, my ultimate goal is to surpass my clients
        expectations of personal service as a Realtor and work as hard as I can
        to make the best deal possible.
